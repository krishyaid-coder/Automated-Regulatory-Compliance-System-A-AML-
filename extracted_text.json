The revision of the FATF Recommendation was adopted\nand published in February 2012. See www.fatf-gafi.org/recommendations for the 2012 FATF Recommendations.\n\nFATF Standards\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n2 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nINTRODUCTION\nMoney laundering methods and techniques change in response to developing counter-measures. In\nrecent years, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 1 has noted increasingly sophisticated\ncombinations of techniques, such as the increased use of legal persons to disguise the true ownership\nand control of illegal proceeds, and an increased use of professionals to provide advice and assistance\nin laundering criminal funds. These factors, combined with the experience gained through the FATF\u2019s\nNon-Cooperative Countries and Territories process, and a number of national and international\ninitiatives, led the FATF to review and revise the Forty Recommendations into a new comprehensive\nframework for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF now calls upon all\ncountries to take the necessary steps to bring their national systems for combating money laundering\nand terrorist financing into compliance with the new FATF Recommendations, and to effectively\nimplement these measures.\nThe review process for revising the Forty Recommendations was an extensive one, open to FATF\nmembers, non-members, observers, financial and other affected sectors and interested parties. This\nconsultation process provided a wide range of input, all of which was considered in the review\nprocess.\nThe revised Forty Recommendations now apply not only to money laundering but also to terrorist\nfinancing, and when combined with the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing\nprovide an enhanced, comprehensive and consistent framework of measures for combating money\nlaundering and terrorist financing. The FATF recognises that countries have diverse legal and\nfinancial systems and so all cannot take identical measures to achieve the common objective,\nespecially over matters of detail. The Recommendations therefore set minimum standards for action\nfor countries to implement the detail according to their particular circumstances and constitutional\nframeworks. The Recommendations cover all the measures that national systems should have in place\nwithin their criminal justice and regulatory systems; the preventive measures to be taken by financial\ninstitutions and certain other businesses and professions; and international co-operation.\nThe original FATF Forty Recommendations were drawn up in 1990 as an initiative to combat the\nmisuse of financial systems by persons laundering drug money. In 1996 the Recommendations were\nrevised for the first time to reflect evolving money laundering typologies. The 1996 Forty\nRecommendations have been endorsed by more than 130 countries and are the international antimoney laundering standard.\nIn October 2001 the FATF expanded its mandate to deal with the issue of the financing of terrorism,\nand took the important step of creating the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing.\nThese Recommendations contain a set of measures aimed at combating the funding of terrorist acts\nand terrorist organisations, and are complementary to the Forty Recommendations2.\nA key element in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism is the need for\ncountries systems to be monitored and evaluated, with respect to these international standards. The\nmutual evaluations conducted by the FATF and FATF-style regional bodies, as well as the\nassessments conducted by the IMF and World Bank, are a vital mechanism for ensuring that the\nFATF Recommendations are effectively implemented by all countries.\n\n1 The FATF is an inter-governmental body which sets standards, and develops and promotes policies to combat\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing. It currently has 36 members: 34 countries and governments and two\ninternational organisations; and more than 20 observers: five FATF-style regional bodies and more than 15 other\ninternational organisations or bodies. A list of all members and observers can be found on the FATF website at\nwww.fatf-gafi.org.\n2 The FATF Forty and Eight Special Recommendations have been recognised by the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Bank as the international standards for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 3\nTHE FORTY RECOMMENDATIONS\nA.\nLEGAL SYSTEMS\nScope of the criminal offence of money laundering\n1.\nCountries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the United Nations Convention\nagainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 (the Vienna\nConvention) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000\n(the Palermo Convention).\nCountries should apply the crime of money laundering to all serious offences, with a view to\nincluding the widest range of predicate offences. Predicate offences may be described by\nreference to all offences, or to a threshold linked either to a category of serious offences or to\nthe penalty of imprisonment applicable to the predicate offence (threshold approach), or to a list\nof predicate offences, or a combination of these approaches.\nWhere countries apply a threshold approach, predicate offences should at a minimum comprise\nall offences that fall within the category of serious offences under their national law or should\ninclude offences which are punishable by a maximum penalty of more than one year\u2019s\nimprisonment or for those countries that have a minimum threshold for offences in their legal\nsystem, predicate offences should comprise all offences, which are punished by a minimum\npenalty of more than six months imprisonment.\nWhichever approach is adopted, each country should at a minimum include a range of offences\nwithin each of the designated categories of offences3.\nPredicate offences for money laundering should extend to conduct that occurred in another\ncountry, which constitutes an offence in that country, and which would have constituted a\npredicate offence had it occurred domestically. Countries may provide that the only prerequisite\nis that the conduct would have constituted a predicate offence had it occurred domestically.\nCountries may provide that the offence of money laundering does not apply to persons who\ncommitted the predicate offence, where this is required by fundamental principles of their\ndomestic law.\n2.\nCountries should ensure that:\na)\nThe intent and knowledge required to prove the offence of money laundering is\nconsistent with the standards set forth in the Vienna and Palermo Conventions, including\nthe concept that such mental state may be inferred from objective factual circumstances.\n\n3 See the definition of \u201cdesignated categories of offences\u201d in the Glossary.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n4 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nb)\nCriminal liability, and, where that is not possible, civil or administrative liability, should\napply to legal persons. This should not preclude parallel criminal, civil or administrative\nproceedings with respect to legal persons in countries in which such forms of liability are\navailable. Legal persons should be subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive\nsanctions. Such measures should be without prejudice to the criminal liability of\nindividuals.\nProvisonal measures and confiscation\n3.\nCountries should adopt measures similar to those set forth in the Vienna and Palermo\nConventions, including legislative measures, to enable their competent authorities to confiscate\nproperty laundered, proceeds from money laundering or predicate offences, instrumentalities\nused in or intended for use in the commission of these offences, or property of corresponding\nvalue, without prejudicing the rights of bona fide third parties.\nSuch measures should include the authority to: (a) identify, trace and evaluate property which is\nsubject to confiscation; (b) carry out provisional measures, such as freezing and seizing, to\nprevent any dealing, transfer or disposal of such property; (c) take steps that will prevent or\nvoid actions that prejudice the State\u2019s ability to recover property that is subject to confiscation;\nand (d) take any appropriate investigative measures.\nCountries may consider adopting measures that allow such proceeds or instrumentalities to be\nconfiscated without requiring a criminal conviction, or which require an offender to\ndemonstrate the lawful origin of the property alleged to be liable to confiscation, to the extent\nthat such a requirement is consistent with the principles of their domestic law.\nB.\nMEASURES TO BE TAKEN BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND NONFINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS TO PREVENT MONEY\nLAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING\n4.\nCountries should ensure that financial institution secrecy laws do not inhibit implementation of\nthe FATF Recommendations.\nCustomer due diligence and record-keeping\n5.*\nFinancial institutions should not keep anonymous accounts or accounts in obviously fictitious\nnames.\n\nFinancial institutions should undertake customer due diligence measures, including identifying\nand verifying the identity of their customers, when:\nestablishing business relations;\ncarrying out occasional transactions: (i) above the applicable designated threshold; or (ii)\nthat are wire transfers in the circumstances covered by the Interpretative Note to Special\nRecommendation VII;\nthere is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or\nthe financial institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained\ncustomer identification data.\n\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 5\nThe customer due diligence (CDD) measures to be taken are as follows:\na) Identifying the customer and verifying that customer\u2019s identity using reliable, independent\nsource documents, data or information4.\nb) Identifying the beneficial owner, and taking reasonable measures to verify the identity of the\nbeneficial owner such that the financial institution is satisfied that it knows who the\nbeneficial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements this should include financial\ninstitutions taking reasonable measures to understand the ownership and control structure of\nthe customer.\nc) Obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.\nd) Conducting ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutiny of transactions\nundertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure that the transactions being\nconducted are consistent with the institution\u2019s knowledge of the customer, their business and\nrisk profile, including, where necessary, the source of funds.\nFinancial institutions should apply each of the CDD measures under (a) to (d) above, but may\ndetermine the extent of such measures on a risk sensitive basis depending on the type of\ncustomer, business relationship or transaction. The measures that are taken should be consistent\nwith any guidelines issued by competent authorities. For higher risk categories, financial\ninstitutions should perform enhanced due diligence. In certain circumstances, where there are\nlow risks, countries may decide that financial institutions can apply reduced or simplified\nmeasures.\nFinancial institutions should verify the identity of the customer and beneficial owner before or\nduring the course of establishing a business relationship or conducting transactions for\noccasional customers. Countries may permit financial institutions to complete the verification\nas soon as reasonably practicable following the establishment of the relationship, where the\nmoney laundering risks are effectively managed and where this is essential not to interrupt the\nnormal conduct of business.\nWhere the financial institution is unable to comply with paragraphs (a) to (c) above, it should\nnot open the account, commence business relations or perform the transaction; or should\nterminate the business relationship; and should consider making a suspicious transactions report\nin relation to the customer.\nThese requirements should apply to all new customers, though financial institutions should also\napply this Recommendation to existing customers on the basis of materiality and risk, and\nshould conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate times.\n6.*\nFinancial institutions should, in relation to politically exposed persons, in addition to performing\nnormal due diligence measures:\na)\nHave appropriate risk management systems to determine whether the customer is a\npolitically exposed person.\n\n4 Reliable, independent source documents, data or information will hereafter be referred to as \u201cidentification\ndata\u201d.\n* Recommendations marked with an asterisk should be read in conjunction with their Interpretative Note.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n6 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nb)\nObtain senior management approval for establishing business relationships with such\ncustomers.\nc)\nTake reasonable measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds.\nd)\nConduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.\n7.\nFinancial institutions should, in relation to cross-border correspondent banking and other\nsimilar relationships, in addition to performing normal due diligence measures:\na)\nGather sufficient information about a respondent institution to understand fully the nature\nof the respondent\u2019s business and to determine from publicly available information the\nreputation of the institution and the quality of supervision, including whether it has been\nsubject to a money laundering or terrorist financing investigation or regulatory action.\nb)\nAssess the respondent institution\u2019s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing\ncontrols.\nc)\nObtain approval from senior management before establishing new correspondent\nrelationships.\nd)\nDocument the respective responsibilities of each institution.\ne)\nWith respect to \u201cpayable-through accounts\u201d, be satisfied that the respondent bank has\nverified the identity of and performed on-going due diligence on the customers having\ndirect access to accounts of the correspondent and that it is able to provide relevant\ncustomer identification data upon request to the correspondent bank.\n8.\nFinancial institutions should pay special attention to any money laundering threats that may\narise from new or developing technologies that might favour anonymity, and take measures, if\nneeded, to prevent their use in money laundering schemes. In particular, financial institutions\nshould have policies and procedures in place to address any specific risks associated with nonface to face business relationships or transactions.\n9.* Countries may permit financial institutions to rely on intermediaries or other third parties to\nperform elements (a) \u2013 (c) of the CDD process or to introduce business, provided that the\ncriteria set out below are met. Where such reliance is permitted, the ultimate responsibility for\ncustomer identification and verification remains with the financial institution relying on the\nthird party.\nThe criteria that should be met are as follows:\na)\nA financial institution relying upon a third party should immediately obtain the necessary\ninformation concerning elements (a) \u2013 (c) of the CDD process. Financial institutions\nshould take adequate steps to satisfy themselves that copies of identification data and\nother relevant documentation relating to the CDD requirements will be made available\nfrom the third party upon request without delay.\nb)\nThe financial institution should satisfy itself that the third party is regulated and\nsupervised for, and has measures in place to comply with CDD requirements in line with\nRecommendations 5 and 10.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 7\nIt is left to each country to determine in which countries the third party that meets the\nconditions can be based, having regard to information available on countries that do not or do\nnot adequately apply the FATF Recommendations.\n10.* Financial institutions should maintain, for at least five years, all necessary records on\ntransactions, both domestic or international, to enable them to comply swiftly with information\nrequests from the competent authorities. Such records must be sufficient to permit\nreconstruction of individual transactions (including the amounts and types of currency involved\nif any) so as to provide, if necessary, evidence for prosecution of criminal activity.\n\nFinancial institutions should keep records on the identification data obtained through the\ncustomer due diligence process (e.g. copies or records of official identification documents like\npassports, identity cards, driving licenses or similar documents), account files and business\ncorrespondence for at least five years after the business relationship is ended.\n\nThe identification data and transaction records should be available to domestic competent\nauthorities upon appropriate authority.\n11.* Financial institutions should pay special attention to all complex, unusual large transactions,\nand all unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent economic or visible lawful\npurpose. The background and purpose of such transactions should, as far as possible, be\nexamined, the findings established in writing, and be available to help competent authorities\nand auditors.\n12.* The customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements set out in Recommendations 5, 6,\nand 8 to 11 apply to designated non-financial businesses and professions in the following\nsituations:\na)\nCasinos \u2013 when customers engage in financial transactions equal to or above the\napplicable designated threshold.\nb)\nReal estate agents - when they are involved in transactions for their client concerning the\nbuying and selling of real estate.\nc)\nDealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones - when they engage in any cash\ntransaction with a customer equal to or above the applicable designated threshold.\nd)\nLawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants when they\nprepare for or carry out transactions for their client concerning the following activities:\n\nbuying and selling of real estate;\n\nmanaging of client money, securities or other assets;\n\nmanagement of bank, savings or securities accounts;\n\norganisation of contributions for the creation, operation or management of\ncompanies;\n\ncreation, operation or management of legal persons or arrangements, and buying and\nselling of business entities.\ne)\nTrust and company service providers when they prepare for or carry out transactions for\na client concerning the activities listed in the definition in the Glossary.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n8 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nReporting of suspicious transactions and compliance\n13.* If a financial institution suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that funds are the\nproceeds of a criminal activity, or are related to terrorist financing, it should be required,\ndirectly by law or regulation, to report promptly its suspicions to the financial intelligence unit\n(FIU).\n14.* Financial institutions, their directors, officers and employees should be:\na)\nProtected by legal provisions from criminal and civil liability for breach of any\nrestriction on disclosure of information imposed by contract or by any legislative,\nregulatory or administrative provision, if they report their suspicions in good faith to the\nFIU, even if they did not know precisely what the underlying criminal activity was, and\nregardless of whether illegal activity actually occurred.\nb)\nProhibited by law from disclosing the fact that a suspicious transaction report (STR) or\nrelated information is being reported to the FIU.\n15.* Financial institutions should develop programmes against money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing. These programmes should include:\na)\nThe development of internal policies, procedures and controls, including appropriate\ncompliance management arrangements, and adequate screening procedures to ensure\nhigh standards when hiring employees.\nb)\nAn ongoing employee training programme.\nc)\nAn audit function to test the system.\n16.* The requirements set out in Recommendations 13 to 15, and 21 apply to all designated nonfinancial businesses and professions, subject to the following qualifications:\na)\nLawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants should be\nrequired to report suspicious transactions when, on behalf of or for a client, they engage\nin a financial transaction in relation to the activities described in Recommendation 12(d).\nCountries are strongly encouraged to extend the reporting requirement to the rest of the\nprofessional activities of accountants, including auditing.\nb)\nDealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones should be required to report\nsuspicious transactions when they engage in any cash transaction with a customer equal\nto or above the applicable designated threshold.\nc)\nTrust and company service providers should be required to report suspicious transactions\nfor a client when, on behalf of or for a client, they engage in a transaction in relation to\nthe activities referred to Recommendation 12(e).\nLawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals, and accountants acting as independent\nlegal professionals, are not required to report their suspicions if the relevant information was\nobtained in circumstances where they are subject to professional secrecy or legal professional\nprivilege.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 9\nOther measures to deter money laundering and terrorist financing\n17. Countries should ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, whether\ncriminal, civil or administrative, are available to deal with natural or legal persons covered by\nthese Recommendations that fail to comply with anti-money laundering or terrorist financing\nrequirements.\n18. Countries should not approve the establishment or accept the continued operation of shell\nbanks. Financial institutions should refuse to enter into, or continue, a correspondent banking\nrelationship with shell banks. Financial institutions should also guard against establishing\nrelations with respondent foreign financial institutions that permit their accounts to be used by\nshell banks.\n19. Countries should consider the feasibility and utility of a system where banks and other financial\ninstitutions and intermediaries would report all domestic and international currency transactions\nabove a fixed amount, to a national central agency with a computerised data base, available to\ncompetent authorities for use in money laundering or terrorist financing cases, subject to strict\nsafeguards to ensure proper use of the information.\n20. Countries should consider applying the FATF Recommendations to businesses and professions,\nother than designated non-financial businesses and professions, that pose a money laundering\nor terrorist financing risk.\n\nCountries should further encourage the development of modern and secure techniques of\nmoney management that are less vulnerable to money laundering.\nMeasures to be taken with respect to countries that do not or insufficiently comply with the FATF\nRecommendations\n21. Financial institutions should give special attention to business relationships and transactions\nwith persons, including companies and financial institutions, from countries which do not or\ninsufficiently apply the FATF Recommendations. Whenever these transactions have no\napparent economic or visible lawful purpose, their background and purpose should, as far as\npossible, be examined, the findings established in writing, and be available to help competent\nauthorities. Where such a country continues not to apply or insufficiently applies the FATF\nRecommendations, countries should be able to apply appropriate countermeasures.\n22. Financial institutions should ensure that the principles applicable to financial institutions, which\nare mentioned above are also applied to branches and majority owned subsidiaries located\nabroad, especially in countries which do not or insufficiently apply the FATF\nRecommendations, to the extent that local applicable laws and regulations permit. When local\napplicable laws and regulations prohibit this implementation, competent authorities in the\ncountry of the parent institution should be informed by the financial institutions that they\ncannot apply the FATF Recommendations.\nRegulation and supervision\n23.* Countries should ensure that financial institutions are subject to adequate regulation and\nsupervision and are effectively implementing the FATF Recommendations. Competent\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n10 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nauthorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to prevent criminals or their\nassociates from holding or being the beneficial owner of a significant or controlling interest or\nholding a management function in a financial institution.\nFor financial institutions subject to the Core Principles, the regulatory and supervisory\nmeasures that apply for prudential purposes and which are also relevant to money laundering,\nshould apply in a similar manner for anti-money laundering and terrorist financing purposes.\nOther financial institutions should be licensed or registered and appropriately regulated, and\nsubject to supervision or oversight for anti-money laundering purposes, having regard to the\nrisk of money laundering or terrorist financing in that sector. At a minimum, businesses\nproviding a service of money or value transfer, or of money or currency changing should be\nlicensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance\nwith national requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n24. Designated non-financial businesses and professions should be subject to regulatory and\nsupervisory measures as set out below.\na)\nCasinos should be subject to a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory regime that\nensures that they have effectively implemented the necessary anti-money laundering and\nterrorist-financing measures. At a minimum:\n\ncasinos should be licensed;\n\ncompetent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to\nprevent criminals or their associates from holding or being the beneficial owner of a\nsignificant or controlling interest, holding a management function in, or being an\noperator of a casino\n\ncompetent authorities should ensure that casinos are effectively supervised for\ncompliance with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\nb) Countries should ensure that the other categories of designated non-financial businesses\nand professions are subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring their\ncompliance with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. This\nshould be performed on a risk-sensitive basis. This may be performed by a government\nauthority or by an appropriate self-regulatory organisation, provided that such an\norganisation can ensure that its members comply with their obligations to combat money\nlaundering and terrorist financing.\n25.* The competent authorities should establish guidelines, and provide feedback which will assist\nfinancial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions in applying\nnational measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and in particular, in\ndetecting and reporting suspicious transactions.\nC.\nINSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER MEASURES NECESSARY IN SYSTEMS FOR\nCOMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING\nCompetent authorities, their powers and resources\n26.* Countries should establish a FIU that serves as a national centre for the receiving (and, as\npermitted, requesting), analysis and dissemination of STR and other information regarding\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 11\npotential money laundering or terrorist financing. The FIU should have access, directly or\nindirectly, on a timely basis to the financial, administrative and law enforcement information\nthat it requires to properly undertake its functions, including the analysis of STR.\n27.* Countries should ensure that designated law enforcement authorities have responsibility for\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing investigations. Countries are encouraged to support\nand develop, as far as possible, special investigative techniques suitable for the investigation of\nmoney laundering, such as controlled delivery, undercover operations and other relevant\ntechniques. Countries are also encouraged to use other effective mechanisms such as the use of\npermanent or temporary groups specialised in asset investigation, and co-operative\ninvestigations with appropriate competent authorities in other countries.\n28. When conducting investigations of money laundering and underlying predicate offences,\ncompetent authorities should be able to obtain documents and information for use in those\ninvestigations, and in prosecutions and related actions. This should include powers to use\ncompulsory measures for the production of records held by financial institutions and other\npersons, for the search of persons and premises, and for the seizure and obtaining of evidence.\n29. Supervisors should have adequate powers to monitor and ensure compliance by financial\ninstitutions with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including\nthe authority to conduct inspections. They should be authorised to compel production of any\ninformation from financial institutions that is relevant to monitoring such compliance, and to\nimpose adequate administrative sanctions for failure to comply with such requirements.\n30. Countries should provide their competent authorities involved in combating money laundering\nand terrorist financing with adequate financial, human and technical resources. Countries\nshould have in place processes to ensure that the staff of those authorities are of high integrity.\n31. Countries should ensure that policy makers, the FIU, law enforcement and supervisors have\neffective mechanisms in place which enable them to co-operate, and where appropriate coordinate domestically with each other concerning the development and implementation of\npolicies and activities to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n32. Countries should ensure that their competent authorities can review the effectiveness of their\nsystems to combat money laundering and terrorist financing systems by maintaining\ncomprehensive statistics on matters relevant to the effectiveness and efficiency of such systems.\nThis should include statistics on the STR received and disseminated; on money laundering and\nterrorist financing investigations, prosecutions and convictions; on property frozen, seized and\nconfiscated; and on mutual legal assistance or other international requests for co-operation.\nTransparency of legal persons and arrangements\n33. Countries should take measures to prevent the unlawful use of legal persons by money\nlaunderers. Countries should ensure that there is adequate, accurate and timely information on\nthe beneficial ownership and control of legal persons that can be obtained or accessed in a\ntimely fashion by competent authorities. In particular, countries that have legal persons that\nare able to issue bearer shares should take appropriate measures to ensure that they are not\nmisused for money laundering and be able to demonstrate the adequacy of those measures.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n12 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nCountries could consider measures to facilitate access to beneficial ownership and control\ninformation to financial institutions undertaking the requirements set out in Recommendation 5.\n34. Countries should take measures to prevent the unlawful use of legal arrangements by money\nlaunderers. In particular, countries should ensure that there is adequate, accurate and timely\ninformation on express trusts, including information on the settlor, trustee and beneficiaries,\nthat can be obtained or accessed in a timely fashion by competent authorities. Countries could\nconsider measures to facilitate access to beneficial ownership and control information to\nfinancial institutions undertaking the requirements set out in Recommendation 5.\nD.\nINTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION\n35. Countries should take immediate steps to become party to and implement fully the Vienna\nConvention, the Palermo Convention, and the 1999 United Nations International Convention\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Countries are also encouraged to ratify and\nimplement other relevant international conventions, such as the 1990 Council of Europe\nConvention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and\nthe 2002 Inter-American Convention against Terrorism.\nMutual legal assistance and extradition\n36. Countries should rapidly, constructively and effectively provide the widest possible range of\nmutual legal assistance in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing investigations,\nprosecutions, and related proceedings. In particular, countries should:\na)\nNot prohibit or place unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions on the provision of\nmutual legal assistance.\nb)\nEnsure that they have clear and efficient processes for the execution of mutual legal\nassistance requests.\nc)\nNot refuse to execute a request for mutual legal assistance on the sole ground that the\noffence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.\nd)\nNot refuse to execute a request for mutual legal assistance on the grounds that laws\nrequire financial institutions to maintain secrecy or confidentiality.\nCountries should ensure that the powers of their competent authorities required under\nRecommendation 28 are also available for use in response to requests for mutual legal\nassistance, and if consistent with their domestic framework, in response to direct requests from\nforeign judicial or law enforcement authorities to domestic counterparts.\nTo avoid conflicts of jurisdiction, consideration should be given to devising and applying\nmechanisms for determining the best venue for prosecution of defendants in the interests of\njustice in cases that are subject to prosecution in more than one country.\n37. Countries should, to the greatest extent possible, render mutual legal assistance notwithstanding\nthe absence of dual criminality.\n\nWhere dual criminality is required for mutual legal assistance or extradition, that requirement\nshould be deemed to be satisfied regardless of whether both countries place the offence within\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 13\nthe same category of offence or denominate the offence by the same terminology, provided that\nboth countries criminalise the conduct underlying the offence.\n38.* There should be authority to take expeditious action in response to requests by foreign countries\nto identify, freeze, seize and confiscate property laundered, proceeds from money laundering or\npredicate offences, instrumentalities used in or intended for use in the commission of these\noffences, or property of corresponding value. There should also be arrangements for coordinating seizure and confiscation proceedings, which may include the sharing of confiscated\nassets.\n39. Countries should recognise money laundering as an extraditable offence. Each country should\neither extradite its own nationals, or where a country does not do so solely on the grounds of\nnationality, that country should, at the request of the country seeking extradition, submit the\ncase without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution of the\noffences set forth in the request. Those authorities should take their decision and conduct their\nproceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a serious nature under the\ndomestic law of that country. The countries concerned should cooperate with each other, in\nparticular on procedural and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecutions.\n\nSubject to their legal frameworks, countries may consider simplifying extradition by allowing\ndirect transmission of extradition requests between appropriate ministries, extraditing persons\nbased only on warrants of arrests or judgements, and/or introducing a simplified extradition of\nconsenting persons who waive formal extradition proceedings.\nOther forms of co-operation\n40.* Countries should ensure that their competent authorities provide the widest possible range of\ninternational co-operation to their foreign counterparts. There should be clear and effective\ngateways to facilitate the prompt and constructive exchange directly between counterparts,\neither spontaneously or upon request, of information relating to both money laundering and the\nunderlying predicate offences. Exchanges should be permitted without unduly restrictive\nconditions. In particular:\na)\nCompetent authorities should not refuse a request for assistance on the sole ground that\nthe request is also considered to involve fiscal matters.\nb)\nCountries should not invoke laws that require financial institutions to maintain secrecy or\nconfidentiality as a ground for refusing to provide co-operation.\nc)\nCompetent authorities should be able to conduct inquiries; and where possible,\ninvestigations; on behalf of foreign counterparts.\nWhere the ability to obtain information sought by a foreign competent authority is not within\nthe mandate of its counterpart, countries are also encouraged to permit a prompt and\nconstructive exchange of information with non-counterparts. Co-operation with foreign\nauthorities other than counterparts could occur directly or indirectly. When uncertain about the\nappropriate avenue to follow, competent authorities should first contact their foreign\ncounterparts for assistance.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n14 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\n\nCountries should establish controls and safeguards to ensure that information exchanged by\ncompetent authorities is used only in an authorised manner, consistent with their obligations\nconcerning privacy and data protection.\n\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 15\nGLOSSARY\n\nIn these Recommendations the following abbreviations and references are used:\n\u201cBeneficial owner\u201d refers to the natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a customer and/or\nthe person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted.

Business relationships with family members or close associates of\nPEPs involve reputational risks similar to those with PEPs themselves. The definition is not intended\nto cover middle ranking or more junior individuals in the foregoing categories.\n\u201cShell bank\u201d means a bank incorporated in a jurisdiction in which it has no physical presence and\nwhich is unaffiliated with a regulated financial group.\n\u201cSTR\u201d refers to suspicious transaction reports.\n\u201cSupervisors\u201d refers to the designated competent authorities responsible for ensuring compliance by\nfinancial institutions with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\u201cthe FATF Recommendations\u201d refers to these Recommendations and to the FATF Special\nRecommendations on Terrorist Financing.\n\n9 This applies both to insurance undertakings and to insurance intermediaries (agents and brokers).\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n18 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\n\nINTERPRETATIVE NOTES\nGeneral\n1.\nReference in this document to \u201ccountries\u201d should be taken to apply equally to \u201cterritories\u201d or\n\u201cjurisdictions\u201d.\n2.\nRecommendations 5-16 and 21-22 state that financial institutions or designated non-financial\nbusinesses and professions should take certain actions. These references require countries to\ntake measures that will oblige financial institutions or designated non-financial businesses and\nprofessions to comply with each Recommendation. The basic obligations under\nRecommendations 5, 10 and 13 should be set out in law or regulation, while more detailed\nelements in those Recommendations, as well as obligations under other Recommendations,\ncould be required either by law or regulation or by other enforceable means issued by a\ncompetent authority.\n3.\nWhere reference is made to a financial institution being satisfied as to a matter, that institution\nmust be able to justify its assessment to competent authorities.\n4.\nTo comply with Recommendations 12 and 16, countries do not need to issue laws or\nregulations that relate exclusively to lawyers, notaries, accountants and the other designated\nnon-financial businesses and professions so long as these businesses or professions are included\nin laws or regulations covering the underlying activities.\n5.\nThe Interpretative Notes that apply to financial institutions are also relevant to designated nonfinancial businesses and professions, where applicable.\nRecommendations 5, 12 and 16\nThe designated thresholds for transactions (under Recommendations 5 and 12) are as follows:\n\nFinancial institutions (for occasional customers under Recommendation 5) -\nUSD/EUR 15 000.\n\nCasinos, including internet casinos (under Recommendation 12) - USD/EUR 3 000\n\nFor dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones when engaged in any cash\ntransaction (under Recommendations 12 and 16) - USD/EUR 15 000.\nFinancial transactions above a designated threshold include situations where the transaction is carried\nout in a single operation or in several operations that appear to be linked.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 19\nRecommendation 5\nCustomer due diligence and tipping off\n1.\nIf, during the establishment or course of the customer relationship, or when conducting\noccasional transactions, a financial institution suspects that transactions relate to money\nlaundering or terrorist financing, then the institution should:\na)\nNormally seek to identify and verify the identity of the customer and the beneficial\nowner, whether permanent or occasional, and irrespective of any exemption or any\ndesignated threshold that might otherwise apply.\nb)\nMake a STR to the FIU in accordance with Recommendation 13.\n2.\nRecommendation 14 prohibits financial institutions, their directors, officers and employees\nfrom disclosing the fact that an STR or related information is being reported to the FIU. A risk\nexists that customers could be unintentionally tipped off when the financial institution is\nseeking to perform its customer due diligence (CDD) obligations in these circumstances. The\ncustomer\u2019s awareness of a possible STR or investigation could compromise future efforts to\ninvestigate the suspected money laundering or terrorist financing operation.\n3.\nTherefore, if financial institutions form a suspicion that transactions relate to money laundering\nor terrorist financing, they should take into account the risk of tipping off when performing the\ncustomer due diligence process. If the institution reasonably believes that performing the CDD\nprocess will tip-off the customer or potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that\nprocess, and should file an STR. Institutions should ensure that their employees are aware of\nand sensitive to these issues when conducting CDD.\nCDD for legal persons and arrangements\n4.\nWhen performing elements (a) and (b) of the CDD process in relation to legal persons or\narrangements, financial institutions should:\na)\nVerify that any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer is so authorised, and\nidentify that person.\nb)\nIdentify the customer and verify its identity - the types of measures that would be\nnormally needed to satisfactorily perform this function would require obtaining proof of\nincorporation or similar evidence of the legal status of the legal person or arrangement,\nas well as information concerning the customer\u2019s name, the names of trustees, legal\nform, address, directors, and provisions regulating the power to bind the legal person or\narrangement.\nc)\nIdentify the beneficial owners, including forming an understanding of the ownership and\ncontrol structure, and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of such persons.\nThe types of measures that would be normally needed to satisfactorily perform this\nfunction would require identifying the natural persons with a controlling interest and\nidentifying the natural persons who comprise the mind and management of the legal\nperson or arrangement. Where the customer or the owner of the controlling interest is a\npublic company that is subject to regulatory disclosure requirements, it is not necessary\nto seek to identify and verify the identity of any shareholder of that company.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n20 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nThe relevant information or data may be obtained from a public register, from the customer or\nfrom other reliable sources.\nReliance on identification and verification already performed\n5.\nThe CDD measures set out in Recommendation 5 do not imply that financial institutions have\nto repeatedly identify and verify the identity of each customer every time that a customer\nconducts a transaction. An institution is entitled to rely on the identification and verification\nsteps that it has already undertaken unless it has doubts about the veracity of that information.\nExamples of situations that might lead an institution to have such doubts could be where there\nis a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer, or where there is a material\nchange in the way that the customer\u2019s account is operated which is not consistent with the\ncustomer\u2019s business profile.\nTiming of verification\n6.\nExamples of the types of circumstances where it would be permissible for verification to be\ncompleted after the establishment of the business relationship, because it would be essential not\nto interrupt the normal conduct of business include:\n\nNon face-to-face business.\n\nSecurities transactions. In the securities industry, companies and intermediaries may be\nrequired to perform transactions very rapidly, according to the market conditions at the\ntime the customer is contacting them, and the performance of the transaction may be\nrequired before verification of identity is completed.\n\nLife insurance business. In relation to life insurance business, countries may permit the\nidentification and verification of the beneficiary under the policy to take place after having\nestablished the business relationship with the policyholder. However, in all such cases,\nidentification and verification should occur at or before the time of payout or the time\nwhere the beneficiary intends to exercise vested rights under the policy.\n7.\nFinancial institutions will also need to adopt risk management procedures with respect to the\nconditions under which a customer may utilise the business relationship prior to verification.\nThese procedures should include a set of measures such as a limitation of the number, types\nand/or amount of transactions that can be performed and the monitoring of large or complex\ntransactions being carried out outside of expected norms for that type of relationship. Financial\ninstitutions should refer to the Basel CDD paper10 (section 2.2.6.) for specific guidance on\nexamples of risk management measures for non-face to face business.\nRequirement to identify existing customers\n8.\nThe principles set out in the Basel CDD paper concerning the identification of existing\ncustomers should serve as guidance when applying customer due diligence processes to\ninstitutions engaged in banking activity, and could apply to other financial institutions where\nrelevant.\n\n10 \u201cBasel CDD paper\u201d refers to the guidance paper on Customer Due Diligence for Banks issued by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision in October 2001.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 21\nSimplified or reduced CDD measures\n9.\nThe general rule is that customers must be subject to the full range of CDD measures, including\nthe requirement to identify the beneficial owner. Nevertheless there are circumstances where\nthe risk of money laundering or terrorist financing is lower, where information on the identity\nof the customer and the beneficial owner of a customer is publicly available, or where adequate\nchecks and controls exist elsewhere in national systems. In such circumstances it could be\nreasonable for a country to allow its financial institutions to apply simplified or reduced CDD\nmeasures when identifying and verifying the identity of the customer and the beneficial owner.\n10.\nExamples of customers where simplified or reduced CDD measures could apply are:\n\nFinancial institutions \u2013 where they are subject to requirements to combat money\nlaundering and terrorist financing consistent with the FATF Recommendations and are\nsupervised for compliance with those controls.\n\nPublic companies that are subject to regulatory disclosure requirements.\n\nGovernment administrations or enterprises.\n11.\nSimplified or reduced CDD measures could also apply to the beneficial owners of pooled\naccounts held by designated non financial businesses or professions provided that those\nbusinesses or professions are subject to requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing consistent with the FATF Recommendations and are subject to effective systems for\nmonitoring and ensuring their compliance with those requirements. Banks should also refer to\nthe Basel CDD paper (section 2.2.4.), which provides specific guidance concerning situations\nwhere an account holding institution may rely on a customer that is a professional financial\nintermediary to perform the customer due diligence on his or its own customers (i.e. the\nbeneficial owners of the bank account). Where relevant, the CDD Paper could also provide\nguidance in relation to similar accounts held by other types of financial institutions.\n12.\nSimplified CDD or reduced measures could also be acceptable for various types of products or\ntransactions such as (examples only):\n\nLife insurance policies where the annual premium is no more than USD/EUR 1 000 or a\nsingle premium of no more than USD/EUR 2 500.\n\nInsurance policies for pension schemes if there is no surrender clause and the policy\ncannot be used as collateral.\n\nA pension, superannuation or similar scheme that provides retirement benefits to\nemployees, where contributions are made by way of deduction from wages and the scheme\nrules do not permit the assignment of a member\u2019s interest under the scheme.\n13.\nCountries could also decide whether financial institutions could apply these simplified\nmeasures only to customers in its own jurisdiction or allow them to do for customers from any\nother jurisdiction that the original country is satisfied is in compliance with and has effectively\nimplemented the FATF Recommendations.\nSimplified CDD measures are not acceptable whenever there is suspicion of money laundering\nor terrorist financing or specific higher risk scenarios apply.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n22 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nRecommendation 6\nCountries are encouraged to extend the requirements of Recommendation 6 to individuals who hold\nprominent public functions in their own country.\nRecommendation 9\nThis Recommendation does not apply to outsourcing or agency relationships.\nThis Recommendation also does not apply to relationships, accounts or transactions between financial\ninstitutions for their clients. Those relationships are addressed by Recommendations 5 and 7.\nRecommendations 10 and 11\nIn relation to insurance business, the word \u201ctransactions\u201d should be understood to refer to the\ninsurance product itself, the premium payment and the benefits.\nRecommendation 13\n1.\nThe reference to criminal activity in Recommendation 13 refers to:\na)\nall criminal acts that would constitute a predicate offence for money laundering in the\njurisdiction; or\nb)\nat a minimum to those offences that would constitute a predicate offence as required by\nRecommendation 1.\nCountries are strongly encouraged to adopt alternative (a). All suspicious transactions,\nincluding attempted transactions, should be reported regardless of the amount of the\ntransaction.\n2.\nIn implementing Recommendation 13, suspicious transactions should be reported by financial\ninstitutions regardless of whether they are also thought to involve tax matters. Countries should\ntake into account that, in order to deter financial institutions from reporting a suspicious\ntransaction, money launderers may seek to state inter alia that their transactions relate to tax\nmatters.\nRecommendation 14 (tipping off)\nWhere lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants acting as independent\nlegal professionals seek to dissuade a client from engaging in illegal activity, this does not amount to\ntipping off.\nRecommendation 15\nThe type and extent of measures to be taken for each of the requirements set out in the\nRecommendation should be appropriate having regard to the risk of money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing and the size of the business.\nFor financial institutions, compliance management arrangements should include the appointment of a\ncompliance officer at the management level.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n\u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD - 23\nRecommendation 16\n1.\nIt is for each jurisdiction to determine the matters that would fall under legal professional\nprivilege or professional secrecy. This would normally cover information lawyers, notaries or\nother independent legal professionals receive from or obtain through one of their clients: (a) in\nthe course of ascertaining the legal position of their client, or (b) in performing their task of\ndefending or representing that client in, or concerning judicial, administrative, arbitration or\nmediation proceedings. Where accountants are subject to the same obligations of secrecy or\nprivilege, then they are also not required to report suspicious transactions.\n2.\nCountries may allow lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants\nto send their STR to their appropriate self-regulatory organisations, provided that there are\nappropriate forms of co-operation between these organisations and the FIU.\nRecommendation 23\nRecommendation 23 should not be read as to require the introduction of a system of regular review of\nlicensing of controlling interests in financial institutions merely for anti-money laundering purposes,\nbut as to stress the desirability of suitability review for controlling shareholders in financial\ninstitutions (banks and non-banks in particular) from a FATF point of view. Hence, where\nshareholder suitability (or \u201cfit and proper\u201d) tests exist, the attention of supervisors should be drawn to\ntheir relevance for anti-money laundering purposes.\nRecommendation 25\nWhen considering the feedback that should be provided, countries should have regard to the FATF\nBest Practice Guidelines on Providing Feedback to Reporting Financial Institutions and Other\nPersons.\nRecommendation 26\nWhere a country has created an FIU, it should consider applying for membership in the Egmont\nGroup. Countries should have regard to the Egmont Group Statement of Purpose, and its Principles\nfor Information Exchange Between Financial Intelligence Units for Money Laundering Cases. These\ndocuments set out important guidance concerning the role and functions of FIUs, and the mechanisms\nfor exchanging information between FIU.\nRecommendation 27\nCountries should consider taking measures, including legislative ones, at the national level, to allow\ntheir competent authorities investigating money laundering cases to postpone or waive the arrest of\nsuspected persons and/or the seizure of the money for the purpose of identifying persons involved in\nsuch activities or for evidence gathering. Without such measures the use of procedures such as\ncontrolled deliveries and undercover operations are precluded.\nFATF 40 Recommendations\n24 - \u00a9 2010 FATF/OECD\nRecommendation 38\nCountries should consider:\na)\nEstablishing an asset forfeiture fund in its respective country into which all or a portion of\nconfiscated property will be deposited for law enforcement, health, education, or other\nappropriate purposes.\nb)\nTaking such measures as may be necessary to enable it to share among or between other\ncountries confiscated property, in particular, when confiscation is directly or indirectly a result\nof co-ordinated law enforcement actions.\nRecommendation 40\n1.\nFor the purposes of this Recommendation:\n\n\u201cCounterparts\u201d refers to authorities that exercise similar responsibilities and functions.\n\n\u201cCompetent authority\u201d refers to all administrative and law enforcement authorities\nconcerned with combating money laundering and terrorist financing, including the FIU\nand supervisors.\n2.\nDepending on the type of competent authority involved and the nature and purpose of the cooperation, different channels can be appropriate for the exchange of information.

    "text": "FIN-2024-FCT1\nJune 28, 2024\nFact Sheet: Proposed Rule to Strengthen and Modernize\nFinancial Institution AML/CFT Programs\n1.\nThe BSA consists of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as amended by the Uniting and\nStrengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001\n(USA PATRIOT Act), Pub. L. 107\u201356 (Oct. 26, 2001), and other statutes, including the AML Act. The BSA is codified at\n12 U.S.C. 1829b, 1951\u20131960, and 31 U.S.C. 5311\u20135314 and 5316\u20135336, and includes notes thereto, with implementing\nregulations at 31 CFR chapter X.\n2.\n31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(1)(C). The rules requiring financial institutions to establish AML/CFT programs are located at 31\nCFR 1020.210 (banks), 1021.210 (casinos and card clubs), 1022.210 (money services businesses), 1023.210 (brokers\nor dealers in securities), 1024.210 (mutual funds), 1025.210 (insurance companies), 1026.210 (futures commission\nmerchants and introducing brokers in commodities), 1027.210 (dealers in precious metals, precious stones, or jewels),\n1028.210 (operators of credit card systems), 1029.210 (loan or finance companies), and 1030.210 (housing government\nsponsored enterprises). The AML/CFT Program NPRM does not address investment advisers.\n3.\nSee CIP provisions located at 31 CFR 1020.220 (banks), 1023.220 (brokers or dealers in securities, or broker-dealers),\n1024.220 (mutual funds), 1026.220 (futures commission merchants and introducing brokers in commodities, or FCMs).\nUnder the proposed rule, these provisions would remain substantively unchanged.\nToday, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking\n(NPRM) to strengthen and modernize financial institutions\u2019 anti-money laundering and countering\nthe financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs. While financial institutions have long maintained\nAML/CFT programs under existing regulations, this proposed rule (or \u201cAML/CFT Program NPRM\u201d)\nwould amend those regulations to expressly require that such programs be effective, risk-based,\nand reasonably designed, enabling financial institutions to focus their resources and attention in a\nmanner consistent with their risk profiles. Effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed AML/CFT\nprograms are critical for protecting national security and the integrity of the U.S. financial system.\nThe proposed amendments are based on changes enacted by the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act\nof 2020 (AML Act) and are a key component of Treasury\u2019s objective of a more effective and risk-based\nAML/CFT regulatory and supervisory regime.\nThe following is a general overview of key elements of the AML/CFT Program NPRM. Please refer to\nthe full NPRM for further details.\nAML/CFT Program Requirements\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)1 requires financial institutions to establish AML/CFT programs that must\ninclude, at minimum, the following components: (1) the development of internal policies, procedures,\nand controls; (2) the designation of a compliance officer; (3) an ongoing employee training program;\nand (4) an independent audit function to test programs.2 The BSA and FinCEN\u2019s implementing\nregulations subject certain types of financial institutions to additional obligations, including\nprovisions related to customer identification programs3 (CIP) and customer due diligence related\nF I N C E N F A C T S H E E T\n\nto legal entity customers4 (CDD), among other requirements. The AML Act amended the BSA by,\namong other things, requiring several changes to the BSA\u2019s AML program requirements, including\nthe insertion of \u201ccountering the financing of terrorism\u201d (CFT) when describing AML program\nrequirements. This proposed rule would adopt these changes.\nThe AML Act requires FinCEN and the appropriate Federal functional regulators to consider certain\nfactors when prescribing minimum standards for AML/CFT programs and examining for compliance\nwith those standards.5 For instance, in proposing this rule, FinCEN and Federal functional regulators\nmust take into consideration that financial institutions are spending private compliance funds\nfor a public and private benefit. FinCEN and Federal functional regulators must also take into\nconsideration the AML Act\u2019s policy goal of extending financial services to the underbanked and\nfacilitating their financial transactions while preventing criminal persons from abusing formal or\ninformal financial services networks. Further, the BSA requires that FinCEN and Federal functional\nregulators consider that effective AML/CFT programs safeguard national security and generate\nsignificant public benefits, and that such programs should be reasonably designed to ensure\ncompliance with the BSA and the regulations promulgated by FinCEN. Finally, the BSA notes that\nAML/CFT programs should be risk-based, including ensuring that more attention and resources of\nfinancial institutions should be directed toward higher-risk customers and activities, consistent with\nthe risk profile of a financial institution, rather than toward lower-risk customers and activities. The\nproposed rule has taken these statutorily required factors into account.\nAML/CFT Priorities\nThe AML Act provides FinCEN with an opportunity to reevaluate the existing requirements for\nfinancial institutions\u2019 AML/CFT programs as part of the Act\u2019s broader goals of strengthening and\nmodernizing the U.S. AML/CFT regime. The AML Act comprehensively updated the BSA for\nthe first time in decades, and it provided several changes to financial institutions\u2019 AML program\nrequirements. Among the most prominent changes is the AML Act\u2019s mandate that FinCEN establish\nand make public government-wide AML/CFT Priorities, and to update them at least once every four\nyears. The AML Act also requires FinCEN to issue regulations incorporating the AML/CFT Priorities\ninto revised program rules. FinCEN issued the AML/CFT Priorities on June 30, 2021,6 and this AML/\nCFT Program NPRM proposes to incorporate them into the program rules.\n4.\nSee CDD provisions located at 31 CFR 1010.230, 1020.210(a)(2)(v) and (b)(2)(v) (banks), 1023.210(b)(5) (broker-dealers),\n1024.210(b)(5) (mutual funds), and 1026.210(b)(5) (FCMs). Under the proposed rule, these provisions would remain\nsubstantively unchanged.\n5.\n31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(2)(B).\n6.\nSee AML/CFT Priorities (June 30, 2021), available at https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-firstnational-amlcft-priorities-and-accompanying-statements. As required by 31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(4)(C), the AML/CFT\nPriorities are consistent with Treasury\u2019s National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing (May\n16, 2024), available at https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2346. The AML/CFT Priorities are supported\nby Treasury\u2019s National Risk Assessments on Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing\n(Feb. 7, 2024), available at https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2080. As also required by 31 U.S.C.\n5318(h)(4)(B), the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, Federal functional regulators, relevant State\nfinancial regulators, and relevant national security agencies, must update the AML/CFT Priorities not less frequently\nthan once every four years.\nF I N C E N F A C T S H E E T\n\nEffective, Risk-Based, and Reasonably Designed AML/CFT Programs\nThe AML Act notes that effective AML/CFT programs safeguard national security and generate\nsignificant public benefits by preventing the flow of illicit funds in the U.S. financial system, and by\nassisting law enforcement and national security agencies with the identification and prosecution of\npersons attempting to launder money and undertake other illicit finance activity. The AML Act further\nprovides that AML/CFT programs are to be risk-based and reasonably designed to ensure compliance\nwith the BSA. As part of the implementation of the AML Act, FinCEN is proposing in the AML/CFT\nProgram NPRM to amend existing program rules to explicitly require financial institutions to establish,\nimplement, and maintain effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed AML/CFT programs.\nFinCEN intends for the proposed rule to enable financial institutions to use the risk assessment\nprocess to prioritize risks and focus their attention and resources in a manner consistent with the risk\nprofile of each individual financial institution. Financial institutions would need to consider the total\namount and nature of the resources available to identify, manage, and mitigate illicit finance activity\nrisks. The importance of this consideration is reflected in the Purposes section of the AML Act and\nthe proposed rule\u2019s focus on fostering innovation in combating financial crime.7\nThe Risk Assessment Process\nThe proposed rule would require a financial institution\u2019s AML/CFT program to include a risk\nassessment process to better enable it to identify and understand its exposure to money laundering,\nterrorist financing, and other illicit finance activity risks. Under the proposed rule, financial\ninstitutions would be expected to use the results of their risk assessment process to develop riskbased internal policies, procedures, and controls in order to manage and mitigate risks, provide\nhighly useful information to government authorities, and further the purposes of the BSA. Though\nmany types of financial institutions currently have risk assessment processes despite the absence of a\nformal requirement, the proposed rule would put into regulation existing expectations and practices.\nThus, the proposed rule standardizes the requirement for a risk assessment process across the\ndifferent types of financial institutions subject to program rules.\nSpecifically, the proposed rule requires the risk assessment process to identify, evaluate, and\ndocument the financial institution\u2019s risks, including consideration of: (1) the AML/CFT Priorities,\nas appropriate; (2) the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks of the financial\ninstitution, based on a periodic evaluation of its business activities, including products, services,\nchannels, customers, intermediaries, and geographic locations; and (3) reports filed by financial\ninstitutions pursuant to 31 CFR chapter X. The proposed rule also includes a provision that financial\ninstitutions periodically review and update their risk assessment process including, at a minimum,\nwhen there are material changes to their ML/TF risks.\n7.\nSee AML Act, sec. 6002(3) (Purposes). The AML Act also noted in section 6002 one of its purposes was \u201cto encourage\ntechnological innovation and the adoption of new technology by financial institutions to more effectively counter\nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism.\u201d\nF I N C E N F A C T S H E E T\n\nPurpose Statement\nThe AML/CFT Program NPRM proposes to establish a new statement in FinCEN\u2019s regulations\ndescribing the purpose of the AML/CFT program requirement. This purpose statement would ensure\nthat a financial institution implements an effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed AML/CFT\nprogram to identify, manage, and mitigate illicit finance activity risks that: complies with the BSA\nand the requirements and prohibitions of FinCEN\u2019s implementing regulations; focuses attention\nand resources in a manner consistent with the risk profile of the financial institution; may include\nconsideration and evaluation of innovative approaches to meet its AML/CFT compliance obligations;\nprovides highly useful reports or records to relevant government authorities; protects the financial\nsystem of the United States from criminal abuse; and safeguards the national security of the United\nStates, including by preventing the flow of illicit funds in the financial system.\nOther Changes to AML/CFT Programs\nThe AML/CFT Program NPRM proposes several other revisions to existing program requirements.\nFor example, the proposed rule reflects the requirement in the BSA, as amended by the AML Act,\nthat the duty to establish, maintain, and enforce a financial institution\u2019s AML/CFT program shall\nremain the responsibility of, and be performed by, persons in the United States who are accessible\nto, and subject to oversight and supervision by, the Secretary of the Treasury and the appropriate\nFederal functional regulator. Additionally, the proposed rule requires that an AML/CFT program\nbe approved, and be subject to oversight, by a financial institution\u2019s board of directors or equivalent\nbody. Further, the AML/CFT Program NPRM would make other revisions, mostly of a technical\nnature, to modernize the program rules and promote clarification and consistency.\nBroader Considerations: Addressing De-risking, Encouraging Innovation, and\nSupporting Feedback Loops\nThe proposed rule also further articulates certain broader considerations for an effective and risk-based\nAML/CFT framework as envisioned by the AML Act. For example, as required by the BSA, FinCEN\nhas considered the goal of extending financial services to the underbanked and facilitating financial\ntransactions while preventing criminal persons from abusing formal or informal financial services\nnetworks. Through its emphasis on risk-based AML/CFT programs, the proposed rule seeks to avoid onesize-fits-all approaches to customer risk that can lead to financial institutions declining to provide financial\nservices to entire categories of customers.\nAdditionally, one of the AML Act\u2019s purposes is to \u201cencourage technological innovation and the adoption\nof new technology by financial institutions to more effectively counter money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism.\u201d8 The proposed rule would provide financial institutions with the ability to\nmodernize their AML/CFT programs with responsible innovation while still managing illicit finance\nactivity risks. Specifically, the NPRM includes a provision that a financial institution\u2019s internal policies,\nprocedures, and controls may provide for its consideration, evaluation, and, as warranted by the\ninstitution\u2019s risk profile and AML/CFT program, implementation of innovative approaches to meet BSA\ncompliance obligations.\n8.\nId.\nF I N C E N F A C T S H E E T\n\nFinCEN also intends for the proposed rule to work in concert with other sections of the AML Act,\nincluding sections 6103 (FinCEN Exchange), 6107 (Establishment of FinCEN Domestic Liaisons),\nand 6206 (Sharing of threat pattern and trend information). Together, the proposed rule and these\nsections would facilitate a focus on the AML/CFT Priorities and their incorporation into risk-based\nprograms, which in turn would feed into critical feedback loops. Various feedback loops currently\nexist between the U.S. government and financial institutions, though prior to the AML Act, they have\nbeen limited in scope, frequency, and the type of feedback shared. The AML Act and the proposed\nrule provide a starting point for more robust feedback loops among FinCEN, law enforcement,\nfinancial regulators, and financial institutions.\nThe Role of the Federal Banking Agencies\nThe proposal that FinCEN is issuing today was prepared in consultation with the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National\nCredit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in order to\ncollectively issue proposed amendments to their respective BSA compliance program rules for the\ninstitutions they supervise.\nNext Steps\nThe AML Act envisions significant reforms to the U.S. AML/CFT regime, and the proposed\namendments in the AML/CFT Program NPRM would set a critical foundation for potential future\nchanges in the AML/CFT framework as part of the multi-step, multi-year implementation of the\nAML Act. With the AML/CFT Program NPRM, FinCEN is communicating its commitment to\nthe AML Act\u2019s purposes of modernizing the AML/CFT regime, encouraging innovation to more\neffectively counter ML/TF, advancing law enforcement and national security objectives, and further\nsafeguarding the U.S. financial system from illicit activity.\nFor Further Information\nFinancial institutions should send questions or comments regarding the contents of this fact sheet to\nthe FinCEN Regulatory Support Section at frc@fincen.gov.",
